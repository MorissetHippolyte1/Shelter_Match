# Project2

ShelterMatch is an application that matches owners/potential dog owners with sheltered dogs.

# Description
This application is designed to help prospective dog owners, dog lovers, and foster parents, to select their desired dog breed, size, and sex from our shelter. What inspired our group to bulid this application was a combination of the heart-breaking event that happens to many dog owners when they lose their dogs; along with the growing number of people with new found interest in dogs. We wanting to faster and efficient way for a owner/ potential owner to find their perfect pet!

When a user first opens our site, a login requests their name and email. The user then has access to the shelters inventory of dogs. The user can then select their preferences on the preferences page. After the user clicks submit, the directory page populates dogs that fit their criteria. The owner/potential owner can then select the dog/dogs they wish to meet along with a date time. Once the potential owner/ owner meets the dog and has decided to adopt said dog, the shelter then post the adoption on the 'Happy Homes' page with the owners permission.

Technologies used to develop ShelterMatch included:
 Node.js and Express.js to Create RESTful APIs
 MySQL2 and Sequelize ORM (Object Relation Mapping) for database storage
 Handlebars were used to create the UI
 Passport, an authentication middleware for Node.js (a techology we chose that was not discussed in class).
