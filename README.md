# Project2

ShelterMatch is an application that matches owners/potential dog owners with sheltered dogs.

# Description
This application is designed to help dog owners, prospective dog owners, dog lovers, and foster parents, to select their desired dog breed, size, and sex from our shelter. What inspired our group to bulid this application was a combination of the heart-breaking event that happens to many dog owners when they lose their dogs; along with the growing number of people with new found interests in dogs. We wanted to develop a faster and more efficient way for a owner/ potential owner to find their perfect pet!


Technologies used to develop ShelterMatch included:
 Node.js and Express.js to Create RESTful APIs
 MySQL2 and Sequelize ORM (Object Relation Mapping) for database storage
 Handlebars were used to create the UI
 Passport, an authentication middleware for Node.js (a techology we chose that was not discussed in class).
 Heroku for deployment
 We followed the MVC model (Model, Views, and Controllers) to develop the structure of our application. 

Our team had the pleasure of debugging challenges while developing this application. The first was connecting the server. To correct this, we simply examined our code for syntacitical errors. The next being unsuring that out tables were properly read by Mysql. This issue took a lot of brainstorming and problem-solving in order to correct.  

# How to install and Run ShelterMatch

To install ShelterMatch by copy and pasting our link into your browser. 

When a user first opens our site, a login requests their name and email. The user then has access to the shelters inventory of dogs. The user can then select their preferences on the preferences page. After the user clicks submit, the directory page populates dogs that fit their criteria. The owner/potential owner can then select the dog/dogs they wish to meet along with a date time. Once the potential owner/ owner meets the dog and has decided to adopt said dog, the shelter then post the adoption on the 'Happy Homes' page with the owners permission.

# How to Use ShelterMatch

ShelterMatch was designed with the intention for easy assessibilty to the public. 
The user uses our app for a faster and more efficent way to find a pet to adopt without the hassle of a stepping foot into to a shelter.
